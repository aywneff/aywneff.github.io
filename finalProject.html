            <h1>Final Project: A Remote Controlled Nightlight</h1>
            <p>
            <h2> The Concept </h2>

            Originally was going to make a mobile for babies the rotated using a DC motor with LEDs that would blink and fade.
            However, when I hooked up the DC motor it rotated too quickly.  It was suggested that I use some gears to slow it down. 
            But that required a lot of guess and check to get the gears the right size to slow down the motor to the right speed
            which time did not allow.  I also had trouble progamming the LEDs to fade while the motor was running.  So, I redirected to
            a nightlight.

            I simplifed the concept to a nightlight with LEDs that would fade.  It is remote controlled to turn it on/off and fade different LEDS.

            The technical implemetation for this project is fairly simple.  The IR remote reciver is connected to pin 7.  Two of the LEDs are connected 
            to digital pins, 4 and 8.  I used a 1,000 ohm resistor for these LEDs because they are either on at full brightness or off.  I thought full 
            brightness with a 220 ohm resistor which I used for the other LEDs was too bright to be soothing.  The other three LEDs are connected to analog 
            pins, 5,6, and 8 with 220 ohm resistors.  These LEDs can fade when 1, 2, or 3 is pressed on the remote.  The power button turns on all of the LEDs 
            and the 0 button turns them off.  This circuit is powered by 5 volt power source from a battery.
